# Beacon Platform

This is just a fork of some Google code. I have to sort out the mess left behind by the Stanford brain-trust. Really Google, is everything you half-baked nowadays? This has ios and Android but I'm only de-borking the Android code.

This repository contains sample apps that demonstrate how to use the
[Proximity Beacon API](https://developers.google.com/beacons/proximity/guides).

- [Android app](samples/android)
- [iOS app](samples/ios)

You can learn more about the [beacon platform](https://developers.google.com/beacons),
the [Proximity Beacon API](https://developers.google.com/beacons/proximity/guides), and
[Eddystone](https://github.com/google/eddystone), an open beacon format from Google.
